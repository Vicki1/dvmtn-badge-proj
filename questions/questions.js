Student can explain what web semantics are and can apply best practices in their HTML files.
Web semantics are the tags that we use  to structure HTML on a webpage. They are 
some of the most basic building pieces of a webpage, and give web developers a 
common base to start off of when building websites. Tags that are outside the body
 are often expected to be laid out with a specific relation to each other. For example, 
 title and metadata  tags will go within the head of the page, which will be within the 
 html tags, but before the body tags. Tags that go within the body, such as header, div,
  paragraph, and span tags can be laid out in almost any number of ways, as long as they 
  are inside the body. It is best practice to lay out the web semantic tags in a way 
  which will make it easy to make use of the box model when it comes to styling.
