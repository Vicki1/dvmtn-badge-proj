Student can explain what web semantics are and can apply best practices in their HTML files.
Web semantics are the tags that we use  to structure HTML on a webpage. They are 
some of the most basic building pieces of a webpage, and give web developers a 
common base to start off of when building websites. Tags that are outside the body
 are often expected to be laid out with a specific relation to each other. For example, 
 title and metadata  tags will go within the head of the page, which will be within the 
 html tags, but before the body tags. Tags that go within the body, such as header, div,
  paragraph, and span tags can be laid out in almost any number of ways, as long as they 
  are inside the body. It is best practice to lay out the web semantic tags in a way 
  which will make it easy to make use of the box model when it comes to styling.

Student can explain how datatypes affect databases and can explain why they chose a certain datatype for a column in their database

Datatypes determine the type of values that are allowed to be saved into any given
 column in a database. These values can be chosen strategically.
For example, I will usually have my id values be integers that can be used as a 
foreign key in other tables on my database on joins.

a DocType tag will make the browser read the file as html file. HTML stands for hypertext markup language and was originally used 
in order for researchers to be able to display their work on the internet in a format that almost all computers would be able to render
for others to read. We have developed many languages and so files can be reaad in many different ways, but doctypes will bring browsers back 
to reading the file in one of the most basic ways.
